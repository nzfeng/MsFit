# MsFit
MsFit (pronounced "misfit") is a crossword construction tool.

# Getting started
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/nzfeng/MsFit
```

# Dependencies
Installing gtkmm4 on Mac is as simple as
```
brew install gtkmm4
```
[This page](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/gtkmm/UsingCMake) was helpful in getting gtkmm to compile with CMake. [This StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/60942488) was also helpful.

gtkmm documentation is [here](https://developer-old.gnome.org/gtkmm-tutorial/stable/index.html.en).

# Interface controls
Controls for navigating the crossword:

* `Space`: Toggle across/down.
* `Tab`: Skip to the next uncompleted word.
* `Esc`: Enter more than one letter in a box.
* Arrow keys: move one box in the corrresponding direction (skipping black squares)

For any box in the grid, black or white:

* `Ctrl`-`X`: Toggle black/white.

# TODO
Support other major crossword types, such as British style, Japanese style, diagramless, etc.

# License
Currently MsFit is a private project.

# Credits
Software engineering-wise, I took organizational inspiration from [Geometry Central](https://github.com/nmwsharp/geometry-central) and [Polyscope](https://github.com/nmwsharp/polyscope).

Patrick Crosby's [xword software](http://xword.sourceforge.net/) was helpful in getting ideas on how to organize the grid using gtkmm.
