A bunch of scripts to help me parse and organize datasets.

* Use Python to extract words from various sources (WordNet, etc.) Output into files organized by word length (get rid of all punctuation.) TODO: Separate wordlist for punctation; user can load in the punctuated wordlist if they want. 
* Manually purge unwanted words from the output wordlists.
* For each scraped dataset, combine their output, organizing by length.
* TODO: Perhaps organize words in each file by some scoring system.
